# Trivy ignore file
# Add one identifier per line to suppress findings you have reviewed and accepted.
# Supported identifiers:
# - CVE IDs (e.g., CVE-2024-12345)
# - GHSA IDs (e.g., GHSA-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx)
# - File or directory patterns when using filesystem scan (fs)
#   Use glob patterns relative to repo root, e.g.
#   node_modules/**
#   tests/**
#
# IMPORTANT: Only ignore issues you have justified as acceptable (e.g.,
# unavailable upstream fix, non-exploitable in your context, or dev-only paths).
# Revisit ignores regularly.
#
# Example (uncomment and replace with your accepted IDs):
# CVE-2023-12345
# GHSA-aaaa-bbbb-cccc
#
# Example to ignore a directory for fs scans:
# node_modules/**
